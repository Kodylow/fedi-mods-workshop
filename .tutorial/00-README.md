### Speaker Info

Kody Low @kodylow

Head of Developer and Product Support at Fedi

## Agenda

Part 1: Federation Setups. We're going to spend the first half hour setting up a bunch of federations on Mutinynet using Fedimint, a privacy and scalingg protocol for running federated chaumian ecash mints on Bitcoin.

Part 2: We're going to connect Fedi, a phone and progressive web application, to our Fedimints and sling some mutinynet sats back and forth to each other (online and offline payments)

Part 3: We're going to write a basic Fedi Mod, an AI website using webln that we can access from within Fedi's in-app browser to make a native bitcoin payment experience.
